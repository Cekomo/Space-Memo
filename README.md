# Space-Memo
Pass the obstacles of space with spacecraft by using your memory.

# Developer note
With the 28th commit, the game has memory system. Firstly, forecast the moves after inspecting the map and watch if the player can move among the obstacles without colliding them. The rocket can be used (simultaenously with moves) to destroy objects with some load duration.

Main mechanisms of the game is completed by having minor issues. 
To make the game playable, I should add new levels, various obstacles and rocket types etc. 

# How to play 
Firstly, inspect the map by using slider or play button and try to memorize the location of objects.
Secondly, touch record button to move the space ship. The obstacles will not be visible in the map 
while the player has control of the space ship. Thirdly, after the map is completed, touching 
playback button will implement the movements that player acted. In that session, if player manages 
to complete the map without hitting any obstacle, the level will be accomplished.
